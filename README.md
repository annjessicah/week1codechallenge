## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade:

- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 59 to 49
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40.

the first function is used to generate a student grade depending on what marks the students scores


# Challenge 2: Speed Detector

Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

the second function calculates or detects the speed of a car


 #Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.

**NB:** Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.

- [KRA Tax Rates](https://www.kra.go.ke/en/individual/calculate-tax/calculating-tax/paye)
- [NHIF and NSSF rates](https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.htm)

the last function calculates payee of an employee after receiving hi salary and allowances then the deductions are cut from his income alongside taxes
